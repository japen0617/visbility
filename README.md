Visibility Control Assessment

## Google Apps Script Backend

The `Code.gs` file provides `doGet`, `doPost`, and `doOptions` functions so
responses can be written to a Google Sheet. Update `SHEET_ID` and `SHEET_NAME`
at the top of `Code.gs` with your destination spreadsheet information. Deploy
the script as a Web App and note the deployment URL for use by your frontend.
